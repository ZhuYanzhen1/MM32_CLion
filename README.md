# MM32_CLion

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.2.2-brightgreen.svg)&nbsp;&nbsp;![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/Build-Passed-success.svg)&nbsp;&nbsp;![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL-blue.svg)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English / [中文](https://github.com/ZhuYanzhen1/MM32_CLion/blob/master/README_CN.md)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is a Windows CLion IDE file for the MM32F3277G9 chip and a circuit design for the main control board based on the MM32F3277G9 chip. The software code contains the link files required for GCC, CMake files, clang-format files, Doxygen configuration files, etc. to ensure that this package is ready to use when it arrives. The hardware mainly contains the schematic and PCB files, and the Gerber files will be released in the form of Releases.The adapted tuning tool is developed using Qt, and the repository contains the Qt source code files for the tool. Some Python scripting tools are also provided for easy development, such as scripts for calculating filter parameters.
